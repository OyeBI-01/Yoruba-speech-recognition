# Yoruba Speech Recognition Model
# Description 
The yoruba speech recognition model is designed to accurately transcribe yoruba language audio to text. The model was implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on dataset gotten from OpenSLR Yoruba Speech Dataset

# Tech Stack
•	Programming Language: Python

•	Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

•	Model Architecture:  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential audio data processing

•	Data Handling: Numpy, Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing

•	Audio Processing: Librosa for audio loading, transformation, and feature extraction

•	ML Utilities: scikit-learn for preprocessing, feature extraction, and evaluation metrics

•	Visualization: Matplotlib (plt) for visualizing data distributions, model performance, and other insights


# Application
Ideal for educational tools, translation projects, cultural preservation, and natural language processing & speech recognition research involving Yoruba Language.
